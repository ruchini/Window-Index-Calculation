# Window Index Calculation

This project includes three Node.js scripts that demonstrate the `getWindowIdx` algorithm for calculating a window index based on the number of periods (`noOfPeriods`) and the current month (`currentMonth`).

### Getting Start

#### How to Use

To use this module in other scripts:



### test_withUserInputs.js

This file contains a Node.js script that takes user inputs for `noOfPeriods` and `currentMonth` to test the `getWindowIdx` algorithm.

#### How to Use

1. **Install Node.js:**
   Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
   https://git@github.com:ruchini/Window-Index-Calculation.git

4. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `test_withUserInputs.js`.

5. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   node test_withUserInputs.js


## Files

### windowIndexCalculator.js

This file contains the implementation of the `getWindowIdx` algorithm, which calculates the window index based on specified rules.

### test_withUserInputs.js
Follow the Prompts:
The script will prompt you to enter the number of periods (noOfPeriods) and the current month (currentMonth).

View the Result:
The script will display the calculated window index based on the provided inputs.

### test_algorithm.js
This file contains a Node.js script that tests the getWindowIdx algorithm for a range of months.
